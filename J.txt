Subject: Request for Work from Home Due to Knee Pain

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope you are doing well. I am experiencing knee pain, which is making it difficult for me to commute to the office. Considering this, I would like to request permission to work from home for a week, from [Start Date] to [End Date], to allow me to rest and recover while continuing my work without any disruption.

Please let me know if this is feasible or if you need any additional information. I appreciate your understanding and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
